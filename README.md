## ![](https://github.com/McDaived/NoRecoil-CS2/assets/18085492/7eab67ab-4b44-40ee-b050-53e48a856fc5)How to use :
1. Compile Sea of Gods by ``VS`` -> select ``release 64x`` -> ``build it.``
2. Inject DLL with ``Process Hacker 2`` or ``Cheat Engine``.. etc.
3. Press ``[INS]`` or ``[HOME]`` to open menu .

**PS: This cheat works on directx 11 make sure force the game to load on dxd11
because now it set by defult on dxd12..**

    
    
    add "-dx11" to steam launch Steam -> Sea of thieves -> Right Click-> Properties-> General-> Launch Options-> -dx11

``before inject dll, open the game go to video settings and change it to direct 11 and restart your game``
